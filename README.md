Problem Statement-Create 2 reports to find important metrics and behaviors
  
Approach-

For Customer Report-

1) I first retreived all the important columns from fact sales and dim products table to do further aggregations and analysis.
2) Then I did Customer Aggregation to summarize the key matrics at customer level for customer report.
3) In the final Query I Combined all customers query into one output.
   - Also did segmenting the customers age group for better understanding.
   - then segmented the customers on the basis of their lifespan and total sales.
   - At last calculated the Average Order Revenue (AOR) and Average Monthly Spend.

For Product Report-

1) I first retreived all the important columns from fact sales and dim products table to do further aggregations and analysis.
2) Then I did Product Aggregation to summarize the key matrics at product level for product report.
3) In the final Query I Combined all products query into one output.
   - Also did segmenting the Product on the basis of their revenue for better understanding.
   - At last calculated the Average Order Revenue (AOR) and Average Monthly Spend.

Finally saved the output of both reports in form of Views.
